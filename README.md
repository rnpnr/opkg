This repo is adapted from [oasis][] but rather than installing as
an OS it is meant to be installed alongside your existing system.

The majority of things are unchanged. Most notably:

* All packages are *statically linked!*

Changes
-------
* Packages have been moved to sorted directories.
* The set of packages is curated to my personal preferences.
* OpenBSD `xargs` instead of sbase for parallel processing support.
* cmark was replaced with [md4c][].

Additional Packages
-------------------
* [hyx][] - tiny hex editor
* [libgit2][] - no network support; needed for stagit.
* [optipng][] - PNG image optimizer
* [spm][] - simpler pass
* [stagit][] - static webpage generator for git repos.
