This repo is adapted from [oasis][] and but rather then installing as
an OS it is meant to be installed alongside your existing system.

The majority of things are unchanged. Most notably:

* All packages are *statically linked!*

Changes
-------
* Packages have been moved to sorted directories.
* Man pages are installed uncompressed.
* The set of packages is curated to my personal preferences.
